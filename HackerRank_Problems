##The pads
Generate the following two result sets:

Query an alphabetically ordered list of all names in OCCUPATIONS, immediately followed by the first letter of each profession as a parenthetical (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order, and output them in the following format:
There are a total of [occupation_count] [occupation]s.
where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name. If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.
Note: There will be at least two entries in the table for each type of occupation.

Input Format
The OCCUPATIONS table is described as follows:

column      type
name        string
occupation  string
Occupation will only contain one of the following values: Doctor, Professor, Singer or Actor.

order by name
select concat('There are a total of', ' ', count(occupation), ' ', 
lower(occupation), 's.') as profession
from occupations
group by occupation
order by profession
